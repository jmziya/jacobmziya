Dear good people.

Hie again.

I read a book by Robert Kiyosaki titled "**Change Your Life Before Breakfast**".

In it, Robert states the 6 steps that can help you change your life, so I thought I should just share with as a Summary.

**1. Clear Your Mind ** (Meditate)

In this step, Roberts says: Shut down the world. Shut down all the exsiting noise. This noise includes, phones, news, your inner voice.

Meditation will give you a centered start to your day for the other 5 steps. This however takes practice. Therefore, you will really need to do this everyday.

**2. Say It ** (Affirmation)

We all hear motivation speeches that tell us to make affirmations. They keep stating out saying: tell yourself that; "I am rich", "I am healthy." That is okay, but don't say them as lies as most people do.

Make affirmations with action. He says; Instead of saying "Money flows to me effortlessly", Say "I'm committed to earning X amount by doing Y action everyday by Z date."

In so doing, this no longer is wishful thinking, it's now an actionable plan.

**3. See It** (Visualization)

**4. Move It ** (Exercise)

**5 Become a Bookworm ** (Read)

**6 Write It Down ** (Journal)

\[...to be continued]: I will continue explaining **Step 3, 4, 5, and 6 ** soon gooed people.

Stay Blessed!!!
