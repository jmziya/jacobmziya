+++

A personal blog is your digital portfolio. Ready made for your next employer, client, or partner. 

It is your digital resume. Let is shine. Let it stand out. Make it clean and simple.

Avoid piling it up with bouncing objects/ effects, and fancy pictures all across, unless you are portraying your graphic design skills, this is not necessarily needed.

Now, where does the power effect come from?

From the simplicity of the website. From the static part of it. 

        Did You Know?
        This website is a static website with an admin interface to let me add Dynamic Blog posts to it.
        
Gone are the days when static was dull. Static is the new Web Dev. cool.
        
PS:/ Don't go static for complex web apps, but, Go static for your Personal Blog to have all the POWER.

Your guy,
Jacob
