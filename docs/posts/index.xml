      <description>Inspire someone today.
Change their lives without even knowing you are doing so.
Inspiration comes in various ways. They may be inspired simply because they saw you help out an old lady cross the road. Maybe because they saw you pick up a coke can on the roads and put it in the street trash bin. Who said you have to speak out loud to inspire a soul?
Just by writing this simple short article someone else will get inspired.</description>
