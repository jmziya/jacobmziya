      <description>A personal blog is your digital portfolio. Ready made for your next employer, client, or partner.
It is your digital resume. Let is shine. Let it stand out. Make it clean and simple.
Avoid piling it up with bouncing objects/ effects, and fancy pictures all across, unless you are portraying your graphic design skills, this is not necessarily needed.
Now, where does the power effect come from?
From the simplicity of the website.</description>

      <description>Inspire someone today.
Change their lives without even knowing you are doing so.
Inspiration comes in various ways. They may be inspired simply because they saw you help out an old lady cross the road. Maybe because they saw you pick up a coke can on the roads and put it in the street trash bin. Who said you have to speak out loud to inspire a soul?
Just by writing this simple short article someone else will get inspired.</description>
